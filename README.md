## Paul's Jets Homework Project

This is my week 2 homework project. It uses OO concepts to implement a fleet of jets. First the user is presented with their jet menu which can display all of their jets, or only display the jet with the highest speed or range. The user also has the ability to add a jet by providing the model, speed, range and price.
